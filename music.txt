This Python script is a simple text-based music player that allows you to play music files from a specified directory. It incorporates features such as repeat mode, random playback, and basic user controls. Let's break down the code step by step:

Importing Necessary Libraries:

os: Used for directory and file operations.
random: Used for shuffling the music files for random playback.
pygame: A popular library for handling audio playback.
list_music_files(music_folder) Function:

This function takes a directory path (music_folder) as an argument.
It uses the os.listdir() function to list all files in the directory.
It filters the files to include only those with ".mp3" or ".wav" extensions.
Returns a list of music files in the folder.
print_song_info(music_file) Function:

This function takes a music file's path (music_file) as an argument.
It attempts to use the eyed3 library to extract artist and title information from the music file.
If the eyed3 library is not available, it returns the basename (filename) of the music file.
play_music(music_folder, repeat_mode=False, random_playback=False) Function:

This function is the main part of the music player.
It accepts the music_folder as the directory path and two optional boolean flags: repeat_mode and random_playback.
It initializes the pygame mixer for audio playback and sets the initial volume to 0.5 (50%).
The function enters a loop to play music tracks.
Loop for Playing Music:

Inside the loop, it checks if there are no more music files in the playlist, and if repeat_mode is enabled, it reloads the music files.
If random_playback is enabled, it shuffles the music files to play them randomly.
It selects the next music file, loads it, and starts playing.
While the music is playing, the user is prompted to enter various commands:
'p' to pause the music.
'r' to resume the music.
'v' to change the volume.
'n' to skip to the next track.
'q' to quit the player.
Handling User Input:

Depending on the user's input, the script pauses, resumes, changes the volume, loads the next track, or quits the player.
If the user quits, the pygame mixer is stopped, and the script exits.
Main Section (if __name__ == '__main__':):

This section is the entry point of the script.
It prompts the user to enter the directory containing music files.
It also asks if the user wants to enable repeat mode and random playback.
Then, it calls the play_music function with the provided options.
This script provides a basic command-line music player with some interactive control options. Users can specify a music folder, enable repeat mode, and choose to play music tracks randomly or in order. The user can control playback using the provided commands during playback.
